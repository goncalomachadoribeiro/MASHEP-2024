QUESTION 1


QUESTION 2

 The two variables used were ptLL and MET. Signal selection optimisation intends to discriminate your signal from the different backgrounds.
As such, we intend to apply cuts in variables to optimise the signal yield but we do not want to loose any signal. It is a compromise between these two.
As plotted in the previous exercise, we observe for these two variables clear signal peaks, which, as a consequence of what was stated earlier, leads to this choice.


QUESTION 3

For the ptLL variable, the cut is at 80.50 GeV.

For the MET variable, the cut is at 65.50 GeV.


QUESTION 4


++ Statistics after my optimised selection
Signal histogram entries 58772 expected events 162.8
Background histogram entries 51369 expected events 710.4
Total S/sqrt(S+B) improved from 5.17 to 5.51


QUESTION 5

The value obtained for mu-hat is 3.59.

The value obtained for q0 is 377.18.

Based on the mu-hat and q0 values, since the mu-hat is > 1 and q0 >> 0, we can argue that the background + signal is the most likely.
Recall that mu-hat is the Maximum-likelihood estimate for mu and it measures the signal strength. In case it was 0, we had no signal; however, that is not the case (mu-hat is 3.60!).
