# MASHEP-2024
MASHEP (Simulation and Analysis Methods in High Energy Physics ) is a course of the Master's in Physics Engineering. This repository contains the three proposed homeworks and a research project regarding the H->ZZ SM process.

Course Syllabus: 

- Introduction and review of previous knowledge (cross section, luminosity, Monte Carlo simulation, particles detection and identification).
- Simulation in physics. Monte Carlo generators. Detector response simulation.
- Signal and background processes. Discriminating variables and experimental signatures. Methods for optimisation of the signal/background separation. Machine Learning methods.
- Data-driven in-situ calibration/correction methods. Determination and application of Monte Carlo corrections (weights, background normalization).
- Deconvolution or unfolding. Basic methods (bin by bin, inverse matrix method). Use of Machine Learning for deconvolution.
- Fits: the likelihood method. Nuisance parameters and constraints.
- Analysis strategy: definition of observables, blind analysis.
