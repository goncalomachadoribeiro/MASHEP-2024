This Directory contains two subdirectories:

# 1: HZZAnalysis.zip

Directory with a global analysis of Signal Strength, Likelihood Function, and Machine Learning Analysis. The important file is 'Analysis_ML_DNN.py'

# 2: Analysis_extra.zip

Directory that contains some more simple analysis done before that one, which paved path for the final code. It contains a plotting, analysis_1 and analysis_2 codes, which intend to recreate the original 'Plotting' and do some very direct Strenth of Signal and Significance Fits.


For all of the codes, they should be compilable by 
'''python3 *name_of_the_python_file.py* -b'''
